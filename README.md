# Chimp

Chimp is a PDF viewer written using Mozilla's amazing PDF.js library. It takes their PDF viewer demo application and adds some bells and whistles like:

* Location/page sync using Dropbox (read on one device, pick up where you left off on another)
* Open PDFs directly from your Dropbox account (no need to have Dropbox installed - you can even open from your mobile device)
* A history of PDF files read from Dropbox (quickly access your most recently read PDFs)

Chimp's only purpose in life is to be a *great* PDF consumer.
